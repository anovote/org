## Retrospective

| What went well                                               | What could improve                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| It has been possible to solve tasks even when we have worked from home | stick to routine with having standups 12.00 every day, even though we work from home or school |
| Nice to have a week with less focus on the project           | Let the task take their time. Make a clear plan of to approach a task |
|                                                              |                                                              |
