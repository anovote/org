## Retrospective

| What went well                                         | What could improve                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| We have written a lot, and are happy with the progress | We hate every minute of writing the report, someone feel they have been a little bit grumpy. |
| All have met at schoool                                | We could try to be more structured and assign more clearly who is to write anything |
| We are working well together at finishing the bachelor |                                                              |
