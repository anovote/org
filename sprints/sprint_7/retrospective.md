## Retrospective

| What went well                                               | What could improve                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Distribution of tasks per group member                       | We overestimated out sprint             |
| Great team spirit                                            | No finished product to show             |
| Everyone wants to create something with quality, not rushing through their tasks | Make sure to utilize our prioritization |
| Assisting others when we need help or are in a rabbit hole   |                                         |
| We are great at looking into others PR even when we have a lot to do |                                         |
|                                                              |                                         |
