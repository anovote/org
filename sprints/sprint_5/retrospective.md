## Retrospective

| What went well                                               | What could improve            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Porting from deno to node went very well. This week has sort of had two seperate sprints, but we worked through it. | take breaks more often, still |
| Handling discussion the next day instead of same day, last hours, was a very effective decision. |                               |
| Starting the day 08.00 has boosted our work spirit           |                               |
|                                                              |                               |
