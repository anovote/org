## Retrospective

| What went well                             | What could improve                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Been able to pass tasks around dynamically | More irritated due to exhaustion                    |
| Kept daily structure                       | Many tired faces. Might be reaction after incubator |
| Manage to get through sprint backlog       | Large workload last few weeks                       |
|                                            | Underestimated the tasks complexity                 |
|                                            | Forgot to include tests as part of task complexity  |
