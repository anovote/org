## Retrospective

| What went well                                               | What could improve                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Started working on the report. Good work spirit so far       | COntext switching between writing and coding have been hard. |
| Balancing the work between report and bug fixing very well   | We have a lot to learn with concentrating for longer burst. We should definiatly help eachother to achieve this |
| We have an empty sprint backlog for a long time :smile:      | Maybe start with writing keywords/bulletpoints first, to help yourself get going with writing |
| We feel the progression is very good. so we don't feel very stressed so far |                                                              |
