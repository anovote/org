# WIKI
Welcome to the wiki for the anovote organization. This repository contains 
all important files, folders, information or useful links we may depend on in our bachelor thesis.

## How its organized
The wiki is organized in pages. adding a new page is a useful way of extending the scope of the wiki. Because of github wikis limitation of structuring the wiki, we have organized all pages (like meetings) in the repository itself, to have a more readable/uncluttered wiki.
