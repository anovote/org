Discussed challenge with how fast project should move.

## 5 How to solve voting problem (confidentiality / anonymity)

The problem can easily become very complex and hard to solve. This might conflict with the time spent to develop functionality

- Make solution simple in the beginning and if we have time make algorithm more robust

## 6 Make structure or functionality first?

Should we structure the project first? Or just start develop function.

- This can be done in parallell.
- Start with one feature and adapt the project as we go
