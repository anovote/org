## Retrospective

>  Last time it was a very hectic period. How are we doing now?

Emil says it has been a nice 2 week period with a little break preparing from exam. 

Anre says it is going to be a hectic period at the end. He says we have to be very aware of going to hard after easter.

If we get to start writing the report early, we should follow our plan. Remember the report is the most important thing to be evaluated on.

### what to add in the report

Most important to reflect the project.

- Add summaries of meetings
- Retrospectives should reflect our difficulties
- About the project
  - Theory
    - SCRUM, base theory
    - The election algorithm
  - Methods
    - Utilities
    - Frameworks
  - Results
    - Theproduct we have made
    - the project results
      - Daily standups
        - Without discussing how it when
    - Hoe we have solved the anomyzation



Arne suggest to start out early so he can come with suggestions
