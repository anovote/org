# Status

We are working again after a break this easter.

We are very selective of which features we want to bring in. Considering it is 2 sprints until feature-freeze. 

About bugfixes, Arne says should be a share of it in every sprint.

## The way going forward

We feel we have good control over what we want to accomplish for the application. The goal further is to prepare reportmaterial in parallel with the development.

The user test would be done individually for next week, then we would do bigger testgroups

#### About bachelor report

We should stick to the traditional bachelor report template. Writing about theories, methods, .., results.. and so on. 

This is important because the bachelor thesis is a bachelor project not a pure software project. 

This makes it easier for the sensors to follow our project and gain an understanding of how much work we have put in.
