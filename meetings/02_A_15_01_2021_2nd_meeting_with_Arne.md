# Meeting notes

### TDD/Testing

- Try to use methods from test driven development, by using tests to if check if an implementation works instead of a "main class". 
- Implementation of continuous integration, which checks our whole solution for every commit/project build.
- GitHub actions, API testing with postman etc.



### Project structure

- Frontend in React with PWA
- Backend in Typescript and Deno.js
- Database is TBD as we do not know yet how our data is going to look.
- Azure for cloud solutions



### Work conditions

- Work from 9-3 every workday, try to work at schools if allowed. 
- Easter is holy :)
- Sprint
  - Standup 12.00 every workday
  - We will try sprints which span 1 week, concerns about how much time goes to sprint meetings.
  - Retrospectives will be written in GitHub wiki
  - If a person has no more work to do that sprint:
    - It is ok to start on an unplanned task, but should be avoided
    - Create a new task for refactoring/ cleaning.



### Gantt chart

- Show Gantt chart for project



### Expenses possibly covered by NTNU

- Anovote domain, 400-600kr
- Cloud servers, price tbd, need to know how our data flow is going to be before we can calculate price

### Help with generating different UML diagrams

Arne has earlier showcased UML software. Could we get a crashcourse and an introduction of how to use it effectivly?
